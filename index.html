      <h1>Ancient Chinese Architecture</h1>
      <h3>Through the Temple of Heaven</h3>
      <p>
        Ancient architecture of a civilization can reveal aspects of its early
        culture. It’s difficult to study early Chinese architecture since most
        buildings were wooden and perished over time.  By looking at the grand
        evolution of ancient Chinese architecture, one will find hardly any
        evolution. Until the modern period, the styles and forms of Chinese
        architecture had remained the same. This resistance to change was
        enforced by chinese imperial rule and Confucius practice that originated
        in the Zhou Dynasty (1066 BCE-256 BCE). When analysing the
        characteristics of ancient Chinese architecture, the details reflect the
        life and culture of the Chinese. Buildings meet functional needs while
        conveying meaning through confucius symbolism.

      <h3>Temple of Heaven</h3>
      <p>Every year before the winter solstice, emperors of Ming, and later Qing
        dynasties, would pray to the heavenly gods for rain and good harvest.
        When the Forbidden City was completed, Beijing became the capital city
        of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Situated in the south of the city was
        the Temple of Heaven. The emperor of China was regarded as the Son
        of Heaven and would interpret the will of the gods. The Temple of
        Heaven was built so the emperor could pray for the success of crops
        and that floods or famine won’t occur.
