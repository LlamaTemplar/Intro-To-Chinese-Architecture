        <h1>Planning of the Temple of Heaven</h1>
        <p>
          The whole temple covers 2.73 million square miles.<sup>19</sup> The area is mostly
          square except for the two northern corners which have curved edges. The
          overall shape of the plot reinforces the idea that heaven is round and
          earth is square. The outer and inner rings of walls are equal to the
          shape of the plot.
          <br><br>
          The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest sits on a three-tier circular marble terrace.<sup>20</sup>
          The temple is inclosed in a rectangular courtyard that consists of three gates,
          with the main gate at the south. The Circular Terrace in the south is also a
          marble circular terrace that consists of three levels.<sup>21</sup>

        <h3>Feng Shui</h3>
        <p>
          Feng Shui is the art of planning and constructing buildings that are in harmony
          with nature using the knowledge of climatology and geophysics.<sup>22</sup> Understanding
          Feng Shui means understanding how the surrounding environment will affect the
          interior and exterior of a building. Feng Shui begun in the West Han dynasty
          (3rd century BCE) and was based on the idea that Earth was alive and had qi
          (energy). An example of being harmous with the environment would be a building
          facing south with hills behind it. The hills would provide protection from wind
          and the front of the house would be heated from the sun.

        </p>
        <h3>City Planning</h3>
        <p>
          There were strict regulations and traditions for imperial city planning.<sup>23</sup>
          The Temple of Heaven was intentionally built in the southern part of
          Beijing because, in ancient China, south represented the color red,
          summer, and happiness. These symbolic values were associated with heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Position was symbolically important as was the city organization. The
          overall shape of imperial cities was square which was, again, a
          physical representation of a square-based Earth.<sup>24</sup> Cities were
          surrounded by walls with the imperial place in the center. The roads
          where all aligned to the north-south or west-east cardinal
          directions.<sup>25</sup> As a result, imperial cities were a collection of square
          blocks that made census recording and population control possible. This
          was necessary during the ancient times, since China had some of
          biggest cities in the world.<sup>26</sup>
