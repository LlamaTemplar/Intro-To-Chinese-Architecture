        <h1>Planning of the Temple of Heaven</h1>
        <p>
          The whole temple covers 2.73 million square miles. The area is mostly
          square except for the two northern corners which have curved edges. The
          overall shape of the plot reinforces the idea that heaven is round and
          earth is square. The outer and inner rings of walls are equal to the
          shape of the plot.
        </p>
        <h3>Environmental Planning</h3>
        <p>
          During the planning of a structure, the environment is taking into
          serious consideration. It was believed that buildings should be synced
          with the surrounding nature and climate.
        </p>
        <h3>City Planning</h3>
        <p>
          There were strict regulations and traditions for imperial city planning.
          The Temple of Heaven was intentionally built in the southern part of
          Beijing because, in ancient China, south represented the color red,
          summer, and happiness. These symbolic values were associated with heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Position was symbolically important as was the city organization. The
          overall shape of imperial cities was square which was, again, a
          physical representation of a square-based Earth. Cities were
          surrounded by walls with the imperial places in the center. The roads
          where all parallel to the north-south and west-east cardinal
          directions. As a result, imperial cities were a collection of square
          blocks that made census taking and population control easier. This
          was necessary during the ancient times, since China had some of
          biggest cities in the world.
