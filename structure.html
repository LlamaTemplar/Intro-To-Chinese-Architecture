      <h3>Roofs</h3>
      <p>
        In Chinese architecture, roofs are the most impressive feature of a
        building. Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest has a three-tiered roof of
        blue glazed tiles. The roof blue color and circular shape is a
        reference to heaven.
        <br><br>
        Functionally, the wide roof and overhang shield the interior during
        the summer but allow the sun to shine inside during the winter when
        the sun is lower. The roof provides the same functionality against
        rain water. The roof forms commonly found throughout China are Gabled, Hipped,
        Half-Hipped/Half-Gabled, pyramidal.The amount of tiers determine
        the importance of the building. The more tiers, the more
        important the building is.

      <h3>Columns</h3>
      <p>
        Qinian Dian roof is supported by twelve outer pillars, an addition
        twelve inner pillars, and lastly, four central pillar.
        <br><br>
        Columns provide the structural support for the roof rather than
        the walls. Since columns are visible, the dimensions of the column
        are relative to the height of the building such that the columns
        have a good sense of proportion. In an addition, columns are placed
        in a regular rhythm and divide the walls. Unlike Western architecture,
        the Chinese make no effort to hide structural elements. In important
        buildings, the columns are decorated with painted patterns.

      <h3>Walls and Windows</h3>
      <p>
        Walls arenâ€™t used for structural support, rather, they act as enclosures
        and screens. Columns, beams, and brackets provide the structural support
        for roofs and floors. This allows the wall thickness to adjust depending
        on the climate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Windows are decorational elements and block the weather.
